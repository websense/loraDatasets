# loraExperimentDatasets
Datasets of received packet traces from LoRa experiments
The two farms are near Heidelberg in south-western Germany. 
The 1 km radio path for the strawberry farm setting is not line of sight passing agricultural areas, a few houses and some trees. 
The tomato farm is a complex radio environment with lots of greenhouses built of glass and steel. 
Distances are only between 100 and 200 m, but the receiver was placed in an office on the ground floor not facing to the 
direction of the field nodes. 3 of the field nodes were placed outdoors and 1 inside a greenhouse.
Data sets (to be added soon) for mobile trials in two settings: a residential area with single story buildings, trees and some hills, 
and a university campus with buildings of up to 5 stories and trees but no hills.

A simulator for exploring energy trade-offs of LoRa parameter settings is availalbe from 
https://github.com/websense/lorasimulator  (python code)
